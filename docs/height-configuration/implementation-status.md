## Testing Recommendations

1. **Core Functionality**
   - Test all height source types (Z-coordinate, attribute, none)
   - Verify preference saving and application
   - Test with various attribute types and ranges

2. **Batch Processing**
   - Test with large datasets (>10,000 features)
   - Verify progress reporting accuracy
   - Test cancellation during processing
   - Check behavior with intentionally invalid data

3. **Error Handling**
   - Test with empty layers
   - Verify behavior when API errors occur
   - Check database transaction integrity
   - Test with various error scenarios

4. **Multi-Layer Application**
   - Test applying to multiple compatible layers
   - Verify handling of mixed compatibility layers
   - Test prevention of duplicate transformations

## Next Development Priorities

1. **Implement batch history view** - Allow users to see past transformations, retry failed ones, and clean up completed batches.

2. **Add detailed error inspection UI** - Create an interface for examining specific errors in failed transformations and providing guidance for resolution.

3. **Implement coordinate caching** - Add a caching system for transformed coordinates to improve performance on frequently used datasets.

4. **Begin building extrusion support** - Start implementing the foundation for extruding building footprints based on height attributes.
