# Real-time Import Updates Not Working

## Issue Description
The import dialog does not receive real-time updates about the import progress, despite successful backend processing.

### Symptoms
1. Import dialog remains stuck on "Importing..."
2. No progress toasts are shown
3. Dialog doesn't close automatically after completion
4. No visual feedback during import process

### Affected Components
1. **Frontend Components**:
   - `components/geo-import/components/geo-import-dialog.tsx` - Main dialog component
   - `components/geo-import/services/import-stream.ts` - Import stream service

2. **Backend Components**:
   - Supabase `realtime_import_logs` table
   - `/api/geo-import/stream` endpoint

## Current Status
- Backend import process works correctly
- Features are successfully imported into PostGIS
- Real-time subscription appears to connect successfully
- Database updates are confirmed working

## Investigation Steps Taken

### 1. Real-time Setup Verification
- Confirmed `realtime_import_logs` is in `supabase_realtime` publication
- Table has all necessary columns published
- No row filters are applied

### 2. Code Changes Attempted
1. **Subscription Configuration**:
   ```typescript
   channel
     .on('postgres_changes', {
       event: 'UPDATE',  // Changed from '*'
       schema: 'public',
       table: 'realtime_import_logs',
       filter: `id=eq.${currentImportLogId}`
     })
   ```

2. **Channel Setup**:
   - Implemented proper method chaining
   - Added cleanup on unmount
   - Improved error handling

3. **Type Definitions**:
   - Added proper interfaces
   - Fixed payload type issues

### 3. Logging Implementation
Added extensive logging throughout the process:
- Channel subscription status
- Real-time update reception
- Import progress events
- Error conditions

## Confirmed Working
1. Backend import process:
   - Features are imported correctly
   - Database records are updated
   - Status changes are recorded

2. Database Configuration:
   - Real-time publications are set up
   - Table is included in publications
   - All necessary columns are published

3. Authentication:
   - Auth state changes are detected
   - Session tokens are valid
   - Permissions are correct

## Potential Issues

### 1. Database Layer
- [ ] Verify triggers for real-time updates
- [ ] Check publication settings in detail
- [ ] Confirm update events are being broadcast

### 2. Network Layer
- [ ] WebSocket connection stability
- [ ] Message size limits
- [ ] Connection timeouts

### 3. Application Layer
- [ ] Possible legacy SSE code interference
- [ ] Multiple subscription handlers
- [ ] Cleanup of old listeners

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions
1. Add WebSocket connection monitoring:
   ```typescript
   supabase.realtime.onOpen(() => console.log('WS Connected'))
   supabase.realtime.onClose(() => console.log('WS Disconnected'))
   ```

2. Test with simplified subscription:
   ```typescript
   const channel = supabase.channel('test')
   channel.on('presence', { event: 'sync' }, () => console.log('sync'))
   ```

3. Search for legacy code:
   - Look for old SSE implementations
   - Check for duplicate subscriptions
   - Verify cleanup handlers

### Investigation Needed
1. **Database Level**:
   - Monitor real-time message flow
   - Verify trigger execution
   - Check message queue status

2. **Application Level**:
   - Test with minimal reproduction case
   - Monitor WebSocket traffic
   - Verify payload formats

3. **Infrastructure Level**:
   - Check Supabase configuration
   - Verify real-time service status
   - Monitor connection stability

## Related Information

### Database Configuration
```sql
-- Current publication setup
SELECT * FROM pg_publication_tables 
WHERE pubname = 'supabase_realtime' 
  AND tablename = 'realtime_import_logs';
```

Result:
```json
{
  "pubname": "supabase_realtime",
  "schemaname": "public",
  "tablename": "realtime_import_logs",
  "attnames": "{id,project_file_id,status,total_features,imported_count,failed_count,collection_id,layer_id,metadata,created_at,updated_at}",
  "rowfilter": null
}
```

### Current Workarounds
None implemented yet. System falls back to manual refresh when dialog is reopened.

## Impact
- Users have no visibility into import progress
- No indication of import completion
- Manual refresh required to see results
- Poor user experience during import process

## Priority
High - Affects core functionality and user experience

## Notes
- Import functionality itself works correctly
- Only the real-time update aspect is affected
- Database configuration appears correct
- WebSocket connection establishes successfully
