# Shapefile Importer Analysis

Last updated: 2025-01-05

> **IMPORTANT: Implementation Status**
> Phase 2 of PostGIS migration is in progress. The processor interface and core components have been updated to support direct PostGIS import. Key components including connection pooling, batch processing, and transaction management have been implemented. The system now supports efficient handling of large datasets with proper error handling and rollback mechanisms.
