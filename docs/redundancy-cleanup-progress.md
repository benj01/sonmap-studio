# Redundancy Cleanup Progress

Last updated: 2025-01-05

## Phase 1: Initial Setup and Shared Components

### Completed âœ…

1. Created shared directory structure:
   ```
   shared/
   â”œâ”€â”€ controls/      # UI components
   â”œâ”€â”€ hooks/        # React hooks
   â”œâ”€â”€ services/     # Shared services
   â””â”€â”€ types/        # Type definitions
   ```

2. Implemented shared controls:
   - ProgressBar
   - ErrorDisplay
   - StatusMessage
   - ActionButton
   - LayerControl
   - FeatureInfo
   - MapControls (consolidated from preview-map/map-controls)
   - ImportDialog (unified import dialog with coordinate system support)

3. Implemented shared hooks:
   - useFeatureState
   - useProcessing
   - useCache
   - useValidation
   - useLayer

4. Implemented shared services:
   - CoordinateSystemService
   - FeatureProcessor

## Phase 2: Component Migration (In Progress ðŸš§)

### Next Steps

1. Remove redundant files:
   - [ ] /components/geo-loader/components/preview-map/components/map-controls.tsx
   - [ ] /components/geo-loader/components/geo-import/components/import-controls.tsx

2. Update imports:
   - [ ] Update components to use shared MapControls
   - [ ] Update components to use shared ImportDialog
   - [ ] Verify all shared hooks are being used

3. Geometry Processing:
   - [ ] Complete validation functionality
   - [ ] Implement repair tools
   - [ ] Add simplification options

## Phase 3: Testing and Validation (Pending ðŸ“‹)

1. Component Testing:
   - [ ] Write unit tests for shared components
   - [ ] Add integration tests for map interactions
   - [ ] Test coordinate system transformations

2. Performance Testing:
   - [ ] Measure load times with shared components
   - [ ] Profile memory usage
   - [ ] Verify cache effectiveness

## Notes

- All shared components are now TypeScript/TSX
- Components use modern React patterns (hooks, functional components)
- Coordinate system support is standardized across components
