# Redundancy Cleanup Progress

Last updated: 2025-01-05

## Phase 1: Initial Setup and Shared Components

### Completed âœ…

1. Created shared directory structure:
   ```
   shared/
   â”œâ”€â”€ controls/      # UI components
   â”œâ”€â”€ hooks/        # React hooks
   â”œâ”€â”€ services/     # Shared services
   â””â”€â”€ types/        # Type definitions
   ```

2. Implemented shared types (`types/index.ts`):
   - Basic type definitions
   - Interface declarations
   - Common props types

3. Created shared UI components:
   - `ProgressBar` component
   - `ErrorDisplay` component
   - `StatusMessage` component
   - `ActionButton` component
   - `LayerControl` component
   - `FeatureInfo` component
   - `MapControls` component (unified from existing code)
   - `ImportDialog` component (unified from existing code)

4. Implemented core services:
   - `CoordinateSystemService` (singleton)
   - `FeatureProcessor` (singleton)
   - Caching mechanisms
   - Transformation logic

5. Created shared hooks:
   - `useFeatureState` (base hook for feature management)
   - `useProcessing` (feature processing hook)
   - `useCache` (caching hook)
   - `useValidation` (feature validation hook)
   - `useLayer` (layer management hook)

### In Progress ðŸš§

1. Feature Processing:
   - [ ] Implement geometry validation
   - [ ] Implement geometry repair
   - [ ] Implement geometry simplification

### Pending ðŸ“‹

1. Migration Tasks:
   - [ ] Update geo-import to use shared components
   - [ ] Update preview-map to use shared components
   - [ ] Remove redundant code
   - [ ] Update tests

2. Documentation:
   - [ ] API documentation
   - [ ] Usage examples
   - [ ] Migration guide

## Files to Delete (After Migration)

1. From geo-import:
   - [x] import-controls.tsx (replaced with shared ImportDialog)
   - [ ] use-coordinate-system.ts (replace with service)
   - [ ] redundant type definitions

2. From preview-map:
   - [x] map-controls.tsx (replaced with shared MapControls)
   - [ ] coordinate handling code
   - [ ] redundant state management

## Next Steps

1. Complete feature processing implementation
2. Start migration of existing components
3. Create documentation

## Implementation Notes

1. Code Organization:
   - All new files are under 500 lines
   - Clear separation of concerns
   - Consistent naming conventions
   - TypeScript for better type safety

2. Performance:
   - Implemented caching where appropriate
   - Used singletons for services
   - Optimized state updates
   - Memory-efficient processing

3. UI Components:
   - Consistent styling with Tailwind CSS
   - Reusable and composable
   - Proper TypeScript types
   - Accessibility support

4. Testing Strategy:
   - Unit tests for services
   - Component tests for UI
   - Integration tests for hooks
   - End-to-end tests for workflows

## Latest Updates

1. Added unified `ImportDialog` component:
   - Builds upon existing implementation
   - Uses shared components and hooks
   - Improved error handling
   - Progress tracking
   - Coordinate system support
   - Layer management
   - File validation
   - Preview support

## Questions to Resolve

1. Should we implement WebWorker support for heavy processing?
2. How should we handle coordinate system transformations for very large datasets?
3. What's the best strategy for cache invalidation?
4. Should we add plugin support for custom processing steps?

## Next Implementation

I'll proceed with implementing the geometry validation, repair, and simplification functionality in the FeatureProcessor service. This will provide core functionality needed by both the import and preview components.
