## Implementation Timeline

| Phase | Duration | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| 1. Foundation | 2 weeks | Setup CesiumJS, create basic viewer, implement view toggle |
| 2. Data Import | 3 weeks | Implement parsers for new file formats, data conversion |
| 3. Visualization | 3 weeks | Implement terrain and 3D model visualization |
| 4. UI/UX | 2 weeks | Implement UI components and interaction patterns |
| 5. Optimization | 2 weeks | Performance tuning, LOD, streaming |
| 6. Testing | 2 weeks | Testing, bug fixes, documentation |
| **Total** | **14 weeks** | |

## Key Considerations

1. **Performance**: Ensure smooth performance even with large datasets
2. **Usability**: Provide intuitive navigation and interaction in 3D
3. **Integration**: Seamless integration with existing 2D functionality
4. **Extensibility**: Design for future enhancements and additional file formats
5. **Accessibility**: Ensure 3D features are accessible to all users

## Next Steps

1. Review and finalize technical specification
2. Set up development environment with CesiumJS
3. Implement foundation components
4. Begin parser extensions for new file formats
5. Develop initial UI prototypes for testing

## Conclusion

This technical specification provides a comprehensive roadmap for implementing 3D visualization capabilities using CesiumJS. By following this plan, we will create a robust and user-friendly 3D visualization solution that integrates seamlessly with the existing application.
