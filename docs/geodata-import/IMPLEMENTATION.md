# Geodata Import Implementation Status

## Current Implementation Overview

The geodata import pipeline has been implemented with a focus on Shapefiles and GeoJSON as the initial supported formats. The implementation follows a user-centric design that emphasizes clarity and ease of use while maintaining robust functionality.

### Core Components

1. **File Management**
   - Two-step process: Upload → Import
   - Clear visual separation between uploaded files and import functionality
   - Support for main files and companion files (e.g., .shp with .dbf, .shx, .prj)
   - Automatic companion file grouping
   - Real-time upload progress tracking

2. **User Interface**
   - Simple and clear file selection button
   - Grid-based file display with clear hierarchy
   - Prominent import actions
   - Visual feedback for file operations
   - Companion file collapsible display
   - Real-time upload progress indicators

3. **Data Processing**
   - Client-side validation and processing
   - Support for both single files and file groups
   - Automatic file type detection
   - Progress tracking throughout the pipeline

## Technical Implementation

### File Upload Flow

```typescript
// Component hierarchy
FileManager (components/files/components/manager/index.tsx)
  → Toolbar (File Selection)
  → FileList (Grid Display)
    → FileItem (Individual File Card)
      → Actions (Import, Download, Delete)
```

### File Processing Pipeline

1. **File Selection**
   ```typescript
   interface FileGroup {
     mainFile: File;
     companions: File[];  // Related files for shapefiles
   }
   ```

2. **Validation & Processing**
   ```typescript
   interface ProcessedFiles {
     main: {
       file: File;
       isValid: boolean;
       error?: string;
     };
     companions: ProcessedFile[];
   }
   ```

3. **Upload Process**
   ```typescript
   interface UploadingFile {
     group: FileGroup;
     progress: number;  // Real-time upload progress
   }
   ```

### UI Components

#### File Upload
- Clear "Select Files for Upload" button
- Drag-and-drop zone with visual feedback
- Support for multiple file selection
- Progress tracking during upload

#### File Display
```typescript
// File card structure
interface FileCard {
  mainInfo: {
    name: string;
    size: string;
    type: string;
  };
  companions?: {
    count: number;
    files: CompanionFile[];
  };
  actions: {
    primary: 'import';
    secondary: ['download', 'delete'];
  };
}
```

#### Import Action
- Prominent "Import" button for each file
- Clear visual hierarchy:
  1. File information
  2. Primary action (Import)
  3. Utility actions (Download, Delete)
- Companion file management with expandable view

## File Type Support

### 1. Shapefiles
- Automatic companion file grouping (.shp, .dbf, .shx, .prj)
- Validation of required companions
- Group upload with progress tracking
- Metadata extraction from .dbf

### 2. GeoJSON
- Direct validation of GeoJSON structure
- Feature collection support
- Property preservation
- Coordinate validation

## Error Handling

### Upload Validation
```typescript
interface ValidationError {
  code: string;        // e.g., 'INVALID_TYPE'
  message: string;     // User-friendly message
  details?: string;    // Technical details
  file?: string;       // Affected file
}
```

### Progress Tracking
```typescript
interface ProgressEvent {
  stage: 'upload' | 'processing' | 'import';
  progress: number;    // 0-100
  file: string;
  details?: string;
}
```

## Best Practices

1. **User Experience**
   - Clear separation of upload and import actions
   - Immediate feedback for all operations
   - Intuitive companion file management
   - Progressive disclosure of advanced features

2. **File Management**
   - Group related files automatically
   - Validate before upload
   - Track progress throughout the pipeline
   - Preserve file relationships in storage

3. **Error Handling**
   - User-friendly error messages
   - Clear recovery steps
   - Detailed logging for debugging
   - Graceful fallbacks
