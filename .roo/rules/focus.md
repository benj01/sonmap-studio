# Stay focused

- when you get specific instructions, do not do anything else but follow these. If you run into any unexpected issues, please get back to me so we can discuss on how to proceed. After you are done, double check your implementation. Again, do not drift off from the main task. If you encounter linter errors, analyze first what needs to be done and what implications potential changes to existing code functions has.
