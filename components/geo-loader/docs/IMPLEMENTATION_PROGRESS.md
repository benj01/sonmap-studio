## Notes on GeoJSON and Layer Information

- GeoJSON supports feature grouping through FeatureCollections
- Layer information preserved in feature properties
- Maintain two data representations:
  1. Original file (as uploaded)
  2. Transformed GeoJSON for visualization

### Structure/Layer View Strategy
- DXF: Parse original file for layer information
- Shapefile: Read DBF for attribute tables
- CSV: Use column headers as layer-like groupings
- Store structure information separately from GeoJSON

### Preview Map Strategy
- Use transformed GeoJSON
- Maintain references to original structure
- Filter features based on layer selection
