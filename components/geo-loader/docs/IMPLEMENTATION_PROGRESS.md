## Technical Implementation Details

### State Management Pattern
```typescript
interface ProcessorState {
  bounds: {
    minX: number;
    minY: number;
    maxX: number;
    maxY: number;
  };
  layers: string[];
  statistics: {
    featureCount: number;
    layerCount: number;
    featureTypes: Record<string, number>;
    failedTransformations: number;
    errors: Array<{
      type: string;
      code: string;
      message?: string;
      count: number;
      details?: Record<string, unknown>;
    }>;
  };
}
```

### Memory Management Configuration
- Buffer Size: 5000 features
- Maximum Buffers: 3
- Memory monitoring enabled
- Progress tracking based on processed bytes

### Coordinate System Handling
- Default input: Swiss LV95
- Default output: WGS84
- Transformation error tracking
- Bounds validation

## Notes on GeoJSON and Layer Information

- GeoJSON supports feature grouping through FeatureCollections
- Layer information preserved in feature properties
- Maintain two data representations:
  1. Original file (as uploaded)
  2. Transformed GeoJSON for visualization

### Structure/Layer View Strategy
- DXF: Parse original file for layer information
- Shapefile: Read DBF for attribute tables
- CSV: Use column headers as layer-like groupings
- Store structure information separately from GeoJSON

### Preview Map Strategy
- Use transformed GeoJSON
- Maintain references to original structure
- Filter features based on layer selection
