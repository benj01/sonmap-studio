# Urgent Updates Needed for Geo-Loader

## Critical Issues

### 1. Coordinate System Handling
- [ ] No validation of coordinate system initialization status before transformations
- [ ] Hardcoded fallback to WGS84 without user notification
- [ ] Limited error recovery for coordinate system initialization failures

### 2. Error Handling
- [ ] Inconsistent error handling patterns across processors
- [ ] Some error messages lack context or details
- [ ] No centralized error tracking system
- [ ] Transformation errors could be better categorized and reported

### 3. Performance Issues
- [ ] Large files processed in single chunks in some processors
- [ ] No streaming support for large file processing
- [ ] Memory inefficient handling of feature collections
- [ ] No caching mechanism for repeated transformations

### 4. Code Organization
- [ ] Duplicate coordinate system logic across files
- [ ] Inconsistent typing between processors
- [ ] No clear separation between core and extended functionality
- [ ] Mixed concerns in preview manager

### 5. Feature Support Limitations
- [ ] Limited coordinate system definitions
- [ ] No support for custom coordinate systems
- [ ] Missing validation for complex geometry types
- [ ] Limited attribute handling in CSV processor

### 6. Testing Gaps
- [ ] Test coverage appears incomplete
- [ ] No stress testing for large datasets
- [ ] Missing edge case handling in transformations
- [ ] Limited validation testing
