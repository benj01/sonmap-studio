- Proper initialization validation

## Benefits

1. **Memory Efficiency**
   - Can now handle files of any size
   - Controlled memory usage
   - Automatic resource cleanup

2. **Performance**
   - Faster processing of large files
   - Reduced memory overhead
   - Efficient caching
   - Smart preview generation

3. **Reliability**
   - Comprehensive error handling
   - Better error recovery
   - Proper coordinate system validation
   - Full test coverage

4. **Maintainability**
   - Clear component separation
   - Consistent error handling
   - Well-documented code
   - Comprehensive tests

## Usage Examples

### Streaming Processing
```typescript
const processor = new StreamingCsvProcessor({
  chunkSize: 64 * 1024,
  maxMemoryMB: 512,
  monitorMemory: true
});

const result = await processor.process(file);
```

### Error Handling
```typescript
geoErrorManager.addError(
  'csv_processor',
  'INVALID_COORDINATES',
  'Invalid coordinate values',
  ErrorSeverity.WARNING,
  { coordinates }
);

const errors = geoErrorManager.getErrors('csv_processor');
```

### Coordinate System Management
```typescript
const manager = coordinateSystemManager.getInstance();
await manager.initialize();

const transformed = await manager.transform(
  point,
  COORDINATE_SYSTEMS.WGS84,
  COORDINATE_SYSTEMS.SWISS_LV95
);
```

### Feature Management
```typescript
const manager = new FeatureManager({
  chunkSize: 1000,
  maxMemoryMB: 256
});

await manager.addFeatures(features);
for await (const feature of manager.getFeatures()) {
  // Process feature
}
```

## Future Considerations

1. **Additional Optimizations**
   - Parallel processing support
   - Worker thread integration
   - GPU acceleration for transformations

2. **Feature Enhancements**
   - More coordinate systems
   - Additional file formats
   - Enhanced preview capabilities

3. **Monitoring**
   - Performance metrics
   - Usage statistics
   - Error analytics

4. **Documentation**
   - API documentation
   - Usage examples
   - Performance guidelines

## Conclusion

The refactoring has successfully addressed all major issues identified in the original URGENT_UPDATES.md:
- ✓ Coordinate system handling improvements
- ✓ Centralized error management
- ✓ Performance optimizations
- ✓ Memory efficiency
- ✓ Code organization
- ✓ Testing coverage

The system is now more robust, efficient, and maintainable, with comprehensive testing ensuring reliability.
