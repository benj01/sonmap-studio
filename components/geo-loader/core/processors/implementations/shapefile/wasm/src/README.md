# üìÇ src

## Overview
This folder contains the core Rust source code for the WebAssembly-based shapefile processing library. It provides functionality for parsing, validating, and converting shapefile geometry data to GeoJSON format with a focus on Swiss coordinate systems.

## üìÑ Files in this folder

| File Name | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `geojson.rs` | Implements GeoJSON data structures and serialization for various geometry types (Point, MultiPoint, LineString, Polygon, etc.). Provides builder methods for creating GeoJSON objects from coordinate data. |
| `geometry.rs` | Core geometry processing functions including coordinate bounds calculation, ring orientation detection, and conversion between shapefile geometry and GeoJSON formats. Includes comprehensive bounds checking for Swiss LV95 coordinates. |
| `lib.rs` | Main library entry point that exposes the WebAssembly interface. Defines the ShapefileProcessor struct and implements geometry processing functions. Provides re-exports of public functionality and initializes error handling. |
| `validation.rs` | Comprehensive validation functions for shapefile format compliance, including header verification, coordinate bounds checking, and geometry type validation. Implements specific validation for Swiss coordinate systems. |

## üîó Dependencies
- wasm-bindgen: WebAssembly binding generation and JavaScript interop
- serde: Serialization support for GeoJSON output
- serde-wasm-bindgen: WebAssembly-specific serialization
- console_error_panic_hook: Improved error handling in browser environment

## ‚öôÔ∏è Usage Notes
- Initialize library with `ShapefileProcessor::new()`
- All geometry coordinates are validated against Swiss LV95 bounds
- GeoJSON output follows RFC 7946 specification
- Error messages are detailed and include context for debugging
- Ring orientation is automatically detected and preserved
- Comprehensive validation is performed on all inputs
