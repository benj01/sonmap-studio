# üìÇ geojson

## Overview
This folder contains the GeoJSON processing implementation for handling geographic data in GeoJSON format. The processor provides functionality for analyzing, sampling, and transforming GeoJSON files with support for coordinate system transformations and large file streaming.

| File Name | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `processor.ts` | Implements GeoJSON file processing with features including metadata extraction, feature sampling, coordinate system detection and transformation, and memory-efficient streaming for large files. |

## üîó Dependencies
- GeoJSON types from `geojson` package
- BaseProcessor from base processing framework
- File system utilities (`fs`)
- LogManager for logging functionality
- Processing interfaces and types from base module

## ‚öôÔ∏è Usage Notes
- Supports both .geojson and .json file extensions
- Handles large files through streaming with configurable sample sizes
- Default sample size is 1000 features
- Automatically detects and transforms coordinate systems
- Includes progress tracking and cancellation support
- Maintains schema detection for feature properties
- Memory-efficient processing for large datasets
