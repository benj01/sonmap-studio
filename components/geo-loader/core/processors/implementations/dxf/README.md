## üìÑ Files in this folder

| File Name | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `FILE_DESCRIPTIONS.md` | Comprehensive documentation of the DXF implementation structure, detailing all components, modules, and type systems. Includes descriptions of parsers, utilities, and module organization. |
| `MIGRATION_PLAN.md` | Detailed plan for migrating from GeoJSON to PostGIS, including implementation steps, entity support, coordinate system handling, and testing requirements. |
| `dxf-processor.ts` | Main processor implementation for DXF files with PostGIS integration. Handles streaming processing, coordinate system transformations, and database operations with comprehensive error handling. |
| `index.ts` | Module exports and documentation for the DXF processing system. Exposes core components including processor, analyzer, transformer, and parser implementations. |
| `parser.ts` | DXF file parser utilizing dxf-parser library. Implements structure analysis, entity parsing, and feature conversion with robust error handling and validation. |
| `types.ts` | Extensive type definitions for DXF structures, including entities, layers, blocks, and PostGIS integration types. Provides comprehensive typing for processor options and analysis results. |
