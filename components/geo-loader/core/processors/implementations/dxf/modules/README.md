## üìÑ Files in this folder

| File Name | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `analyzer.ts` | DXF analysis module for coordinate system detection and bounds calculation. Features sophisticated coordinate range analysis and confidence-based system detection. |
| `coordinate-handler.ts` | Manages coordinate system transformations and validations. Handles initialization, verification, and coordinate system conversions with debug logging. |
| `database-manager.ts` | PostGIS database operations manager for DXF data. Handles feature collections, layer management, and batch imports with transaction support. |
| `entity-processor.ts` | Processes DXF entities into GeoJSON features. Provides comprehensive validation, geometry conversion, and property handling with detailed logging. |
| `file-processor.ts` | Core file processing implementation with chunk-based handling. Manages file parsing, validation, and coordinate system detection. |
| `layer-processor.ts` | Layer management module with caching and validation. Handles layer extraction, system layer filtering, and attribute management. |
| `postgis-converter.ts` | Converts DXF entities to PostGIS geometries. Implements sophisticated geometry transformations including arcs, ellipses, and splines. |
| `state-manager.ts` | Manages processing state and statistics tracking. Handles feature counts, transformations, and error tracking with system property filtering. |
| `transformer.ts` | Coordinate transformation implementation with detailed validation. Handles entity-specific transformations and bounds conversion with comprehensive error handling. |
