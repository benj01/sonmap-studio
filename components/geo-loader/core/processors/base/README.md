## üìÑ Files in this folder

| File Name | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `base-processor.ts` | Abstract base processor class implementing common functionality for file processing. Includes memory management, coordinate system handling, progress tracking, and feature transformation capabilities. |
| `interfaces.ts` | Comprehensive interface definitions for the processing system. Defines core interfaces for processors, event handling, file parsing, coordinate transformation, and PostGIS operations. |
| `processor.ts` | Base geo processor implementation and interface definition. Provides abstract base class with common functionality for file processing, analysis, and sampling. |
| `registry.ts` | Processor registry implementation managing available processors. Handles processor registration, file type matching, and processor instantiation with logging support. |
| `types.ts` | Type definitions for the processing system, including processor results, options, events, errors, and data structures. Contains comprehensive types for file processing and database operations. |
