# üìÇ core

## Overview
This folder contains 5 file(s) related to core functionality for geographic data processing, caching, error handling, and file management.

## üìÑ Files in this folder

| File Name | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| `cache-manager.ts` | Singleton manager for caching coordinate transformations and preview generation. Implements memory-efficient caching with TTL, size limits, and statistics tracking. Features automatic cache pruning and hit rate monitoring. |
| `error-manager.ts` | Global error management system for geographic operations. Provides structured error logging with severity levels, context tracking, and error grouping. Includes features for error filtering, summaries, and automatic cleanup of old errors. |
| `feature-manager.ts` | Memory-efficient manager for geographic features with chunking and streaming support. Handles large datasets through batched processing, visibility management, and memory monitoring. Includes comprehensive debugging and statistics. |
| `file-type-config.ts` | Configuration manager for different geographic file types. Defines companion file requirements, validates file relationships, and provides MIME type mapping for various geo-spatial formats like Shapefiles, DXF, and CSV. |
| `stream-processor.ts` | Base class for processing large geographic files through streaming. Implements chunk-based processing with memory monitoring, progress tracking, and cancellation support. Handles coordinate system transformations and feature collection. |
