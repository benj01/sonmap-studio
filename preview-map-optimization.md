# Preview Map Optimization Process

## Initial State
- Log file size: ~1.5M characters
- Main issue: Excessive logging and re-renders
- Primary symptom: Continuous "No features to render" log entries

## Current State
- Log file size: ~1.8M characters (increased)
- Previous optimizations not effective
- Identified core issues with component architecture

## Identified Issues
1. **Critical Issues**
   - [x] Incorrect math operation precedence in viewport bounds calculation
   - [x] Ineffective debouncing of viewport updates
   - [x] Multiple independent logging sources
   - [ ] React development mode effects

2. **Performance Issues**
   - [x] Unnecessary re-renders from object reference changes
   - [x] Async operation race conditions
   - [x] Insufficient memoization

3. **Architectural Issues**
   - [ ] No centralized logging strategy
   - [ ] Complex update chain
   - [ ] State management inefficiencies

## Optimization Steps

### Phase 1: Fix Critical Math and Debouncing (Partially Effective)
1. [x] Fix math operation precedence in viewport bounds calculation
2. [x] Implement proper debouncing for viewport updates
3. [x] Additional viewport optimization
4. [x] Test and measure impact on log file size
   - Result: Not effective, log file size increased

### Phase 2: Component Architecture Revision
1. [x] Remove unnecessary logging from LineLayer
2. [x] Optimize MapLayers component
   - Added proper memoization
   - Removed expensive JSON.stringify comparisons
   - Implemented efficient feature comparison
3. [x] Minimize component re-renders
   - Added React.memo to LineLayer
   - Improved comparison functions
   - Removed unnecessary effect dependencies
4. [ ] Test and measure impact

### Phase 3: Logging Strategy (Next Steps)
1. [ ] Implement centralized logging strategy
2. [ ] Add log level controls
3. [ ] Consolidate logging sources
4. [ ] Test and measure impact

### Phase 4: State Management
1. [ ] Streamline update chain
2. [ ] Improve state management
3. [ ] Final testing and measurements

## Progress Log

### [Current Date] - Initial Fixes
- Initial analysis completed
- Phase 1 optimizations implemented
- Result: Not effective (log file increased to 1.8M)

### [Current Date] - Strategy Change
- Changed approach to focus on component architecture
- Implemented major changes:
  1. Removed all unnecessary logging
  2. Improved component memoization
  3. Optimized render performance
  4. Removed expensive comparisons

### Next Steps
1. Test current changes and measure impact
2. If logging is still excessive:
   - Implement centralized logging strategy
   - Add proper log level controls
   - Consider disabling development logging completely
3. If performance issues persist:
   - Review state management approach
   - Consider reducing update frequency further
