## Known Issues

1. DXF Import and Preview (Critical)
   - Feature conversion fails silently in entity parser
   - Preview map receives no features despite successful parsing
   - Multiple validation points may cause silent failures
   - Error context missing in conversion chain
   - See bug_track/active/dxf-preview-generation.md for details

2. Performance
   - Parallel processing not yet implemented
   - Some memory optimization opportunities remain
   - Cache invalidation could be improved
   - Some operations could be optimized

3. Documentation
   - Some advanced features need better documentation
   - More examples needed for complex use cases
   - Performance guidelines could be expanded
   - API documentation could be more detailed

4. User Experience
   - Error messages could be more user-friendly
   - Progress reporting could be more detailed
   - Debugging tools could be improved

5. Coordinate System Detection and Import Flow
   - Simple DXF files may not detect coordinate system due to strict confidence thresholds
   - Multiple error handlers causing fragmented error reporting
   - Preview generation and layer visibility issues
   - Component communication and state management problems
   - See URGENT_TODOS.md for detailed analysis and action items
