# Debug Tracking Log

## Issue Status: RESOLVED
**Issue Identifier:** import-dialog-accessibility
**Component:** GeoImportDialog
**Impact Level:** Medium
**Tags:** #accessibility #ui #dialog

### Problem Statement
Import dialog was showing errors related to missing aria-describedby attributes, affecting accessibility compliance.

### Error Indicators
- Console warning about missing "Description" or "aria-describedby"
- Error stack trace pointing to GeoImportDialog component
- Accessibility validation failures

## Key Discoveries
- Discovery #1: Dialog component from Radix UI requires proper aria attributes
  - Previous understanding: Basic dialog structure was sufficient
  - Actual behavior: Radix enforces accessibility requirements
  - Implication: Need to use DialogTitle and DialogDescription components
  - Impact: Improves screen reader compatibility

## Solution Attempts Log

### Attempt #1 - Add Accessibility Components - SUCCESS
**Hypothesis:** Adding proper Radix UI accessibility components will resolve the aria-describedby errors
**Tags:** #accessibility #radix-ui
**Approach:** Added DialogTitle and DialogDescription components with screen-reader-only content

**Changes Overview:**
```diff
components/geo-loader/components/geo-import/dialog.tsx | +4 lines changed
```

**Critical Code Changes:**
```typescript
// Added imports
import { Dialog, DialogContent, DialogTitle, DialogDescription } from 'components/ui/dialog';

// Added accessibility components
<DialogTitle className="sr-only">Import {file.name}</DialogTitle>
<DialogDescription className="sr-only">
  Import dialog for processing and analyzing {file.name} with coordinate system and layer selection options
</DialogDescription>
```

**Outcome:** Success
- Resolved aria-describedby warnings
- Improved accessibility for screen readers
- Maintained existing visual design using sr-only class

## Current Understanding
- Radix UI Dialog requires explicit accessibility attributes
- DialogTitle and DialogDescription components handle aria attributes automatically
- Screen reader only content can be added without affecting visual layout
- Proper accessibility structure improves user experience for assistive technologies

## Next Steps
1. Consider adding similar accessibility improvements to other dialogs
2. Add automated accessibility testing to prevent similar issues
3. Document accessibility requirements in component guidelines
