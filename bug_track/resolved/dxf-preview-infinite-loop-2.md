# Debug Tracking Log

## Issue Status: RESOLVED
**Issue Identifier:** dxf-preview-infinite-loop-2
**Component:** PreviewManager
**Impact Level:** High
**Tags:** #performance #preview #caching #state-management

### Problem Statement
The DXF preview was entering an infinite loop during feature categorization, causing excessive re-renders and performance issues. The preview manager was repeatedly categorizing the same features without caching the results.

### Error Indicators
- Repeated debug logs showing the same feature being categorized multiple times
- Console output showing continuous preview collection updates
- Performance degradation during DXF preview
- High CPU usage during preview generation

## Key Discoveries
- Discovery #1: Preview Collection Caching
  - Previous understanding: Preview collections were being regenerated only when necessary
  - Actual behavior: Collections were being regenerated on every getPreviewCollections call
  - Implication: This caused unnecessary iterations over features and state updates
  - Impact: Added caching mechanism to store categorized features

- Discovery #2: State Update Triggers
  - Previous understanding: State updates were properly debounced
  - Actual behavior: Multiple components were triggering state updates independently
  - Implication: This led to cascading updates and re-renders
  - Impact: Implemented more granular state management

## Understanding Corrections
- Correction #1: Collection Management
  - What we thought: Feature collections needed to be regenerated for accuracy
  - Why it was wrong: Most collection data remained static between updates
  - Actual issue: No caching mechanism for categorized features
  - Required changes: Added collectionsCache to PreviewManager

- Correction #2: Option Updates
  - What we thought: All option changes required collection regeneration
  - Why it was wrong: Only certain options affect collections
  - Actual issue: Cache was being invalidated too frequently
  - Required changes: Added selective cache invalidation based on option type

## Solution Attempts Log

### Attempt #1 - Collection Caching
**Hypothesis:** Caching preview collections will prevent unnecessary recalculation
**Tags:** #caching #performance
**Approach:** Added cache storage in PreviewManager

**Changes Overview:**
```diff
preview-manager.ts | +50 Added collectionsCache property and caching logic
```

**Outcome:** Partial success - Reduced calculations but still some unnecessary updates

### Attempt #2 - Selective Cache Invalidation
**Hypothesis:** Only certain option changes require cache invalidation
**Tags:** #optimization #state-management
**Approach:** Added logic to check which options require cache invalidation

**Changes Overview:**
```diff
preview-manager.ts | +30 Added selective cache invalidation
```

**Outcome:** Success - Properly manages cache lifecycle

## Final Solution
1. Added collections cache to store categorized features
2. Implemented selective cache invalidation
3. Changed console.log to console.debug
4. Added proper cleanup on feature updates

## Remaining Considerations
- Monitor memory usage with large feature sets
- Consider adding cache size limits
- Add cache statistics for monitoring
- Consider adding cache persistence for frequently used files

## Related Issues
- Layer visibility toggling not affecting preview display
- Preview update performance with large files
