# Debug Tracking Log

## Issue Status: RESOLVED
**Issue Identifier:** dxf-preview-infinite-loop
**Component:** DXF Import Preview
**Impact Level:** High
**Tags:** #dxf #preview #performance #infinite-loop

### Problem Statement
After DXF import and initial preview display, any user interaction with UI elements (buttons, dropdowns, toggles) would trigger an infinite loop in the preview update cycle, causing excessive CPU usage and potential browser crashes.

### Error Indicators
- Continuous console logs showing preview collection updates
- Repeated calls to getPreviewCollections()
- High CPU usage after UI interactions
- Browser becoming unresponsive

## Key Discoveries
1. Preview Manager State Management
   - Previous understanding: Modifying previewManager options in place was safe
   - Actual behavior: In-place modifications trigger cascading re-renders
   - Implication: Need to create new previewManager instances instead
   - Impact: Prevents infinite update cycles

2. Component Update Chain
   - Found that layer visibility changes were causing unnecessary preview regeneration
   - PreviewSection was re-rendering without proper dependency checks
   - PreviewMap was updating collections without debouncing
   - Multiple components were reacting to the same state changes

3. Coordinate System State
   - Previous understanding: Coordinate system changes could be applied immediately
   - Actual behavior: Need separate pending and active states
   - Implication: Prevents unnecessary coordinate transformations
   - Impact: Reduces unnecessary preview updates

## Understanding Corrections
1. Preview Manager Updates
   - What we thought: Modifying options in place was efficient
   - Why it was wrong: Caused unnecessary re-renders and state updates
   - Corrected understanding: Need new instances for significant changes
   - Changes needed: Create new previewManager on visibility changes

2. State Management
   - What we thought: State updates were properly isolated
   - Why it was wrong: Components were tightly coupled through state
   - Corrected understanding: Need better state isolation and update control
   - Changes needed: Add proper dependency management and debouncing

## Solution Attempts Log

### Attempt #1 - Preview Manager Modification
**Hypothesis:** In-place modification of previewManager causes re-render cycles
**Approach:** Create new previewManager instance on visibility changes

**Changes:**
- Modified handleLayerVisibilityToggle to create new instance
- Transferred existing features to new instance
- Added proper cleanup

**Outcome:** Partial success - reduced update frequency but didn't eliminate problem

### Attempt #2 - Component Dependencies
**Hypothesis:** Incorrect dependencies in useEffect causing unnecessary updates
**Approach:** Fix dependencies and add proper type safety

**Changes:**
- Updated UseMapViewResult type for viewport bounds
- Fixed MapMouseEvent handling
- Added proper cleanup in useEffect hooks

**Outcome:** Improved but still some unnecessary updates

### Attempt #3 - Update Debouncing
**Hypothesis:** Rapid updates causing render cascade
**Approach:** Add debouncing to preview collection updates

**Changes:**
- Added debouncing in PreviewMap
- Improved coordinate system state management
- Added better type safety throughout

**Outcome:** Success - fixed infinite loop issue

## Final Solution
The infinite loop was fixed by:
1. Creating new previewManager instances instead of modifying in place
2. Adding proper debouncing for preview collection updates
3. Fixing coordinate system state management
4. Implementing proper cleanup in useEffect hooks
5. Adding type safety improvements throughout the codebase

## Remaining Considerations
1. Performance monitoring needed for large DXF files
2. Consider implementing preview caching improvements
3. Add stress testing for rapid UI interactions
4. Consider adding error boundaries for preview components
