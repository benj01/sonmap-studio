# Debug Tracking Log

## Issue Status: ACTIVE
**Issue Identifier:** dxf-group-code-parsing
**Component:** DxfProcessor
**Impact Level:** High
**Tags:** #dxf #parser #analysis #bug

### Problem Statement
DXF file analysis fails during initial processing due to missing values for group codes. The error occurs during the first line of the file, suggesting a potential issue with file encoding or line reading.

### Error Indicators
- Error message: "Failed to analyze DXF file: Malformed DXF: Missing value for group code 10 at line 1"
- Analysis fails in DxfProcessor during analyzeFile
- No entities or features processed
- Import dialog shows error state
- Debug logs show the error occurs in the DXF processor's analyze method

## Key Discoveries
- Discovery #1: Analysis Failure Point
  - Error occurs at the very start of file analysis
  - Specifically fails on group code 10
  - Line 1 is reported as problematic
  - Impact: Prevents any further processing of the file

- Discovery #2: Error Context
  - Error occurs in DxfProcessor.analyze
  - File content is being read correctly (visible in logs)
  - Parser fails to find value for group code
  - Impact: Parser may be misinterpreting file structure

- Discovery #3: Previous Fix Assessment
  - Previous fix focused on indentation handling
  - Real issue appears to be with group code pairing
  - Line counting may be incorrect
  - Impact: Need to focus on basic file structure parsing

- Discovery #4: Debug Log Analysis
  - Logs show file is being read
  - Analysis starts but fails immediately
  - Error is consistent across attempts
  - Impact: Issue is reproducible and occurs early in process

## Current Understanding
1. Parser Status:
   - File is being read successfully
   - Initial analysis starts correctly
   - Parser fails on first group code check
   - No further processing occurs

2. Data Flow Issues:
   - File loading → Success
   - Content reading → Success
   - Group code parsing → Failure at line 1
   - Analysis → Not reached

3. Required Fixes:
   - Review group code 10 handling specifically
   - Check file reading mechanism
   - Verify line counting logic
   - Improve error context with file content

## Solution Attempts Log

### Attempt #1 - Robust Group Code Parsing
**Hypothesis:** Parser fails due to strict line pairing and whitespace handling
**Tags:** #parsing #whitespace #analysis #error-handling
**Approach:** Implement more resilient line parsing with better error handling

**Changes Overview:**
1. Updated parseGroupCodes implementation:
   ```typescript
   function parseGroupCodes(content: string): Array<[number, string]> {
     const lines = content.split(/\r\n|\r|\n/).map(line => line.trim());
     const groupCodes: Array<[number, string]> = [];
     let i = 0;
     let lineNumber = 1;
     const errors: string[] = [];

     while (i < lines.length) {
       // Skip empty lines
       if (!lines[i]) {
         i++;
         lineNumber++;
         continue;
       }

       // Try to parse group code
       const code = parseInt(lines[i]);
       if (isNaN(code)) {
         errors.push(`Invalid group code at line ${lineNumber}: "${lines[i]}"`);
         i++;
         lineNumber++;
         continue;
       }

       // Look for corresponding value
       let value = '';
       let valueFound = false;
       let j = i + 1;
       while (j < lines.length) {
         if (lines[j].trim()) {
           value = lines[j].trim();
           valueFound = true;
           i = j + 1;
           break;
         }
         j++;
       }

       if (!valueFound) {
         errors.push(`Missing value for group code ${code} at line ${lineNumber}`);
         break;
       }

       groupCodes.push([code, value]);
       lineNumber += (j - i) + 2;
     }

     // Handle errors appropriately
     if (errors.length > 0 && groupCodes.length > 0) {
       console.warn('DXF parsing warnings:', errors);
     } else if (errors.length > 0) {
       throw new Error(`Malformed DXF: ${errors[0]}`);
     } else if (groupCodes.length === 0) {
       throw new Error('Malformed DXF: No valid group code pairs found');
     }

     return groupCodes;
   }
   ```

2. Key improvements:
   - More resilient line parsing:
     * Skips empty lines properly
     * Handles indented content
     * Continues parsing after invalid lines
   - Better error handling:
     * Collects all parsing errors
     * Provides line numbers in errors
     * Warns about issues if some pairs valid
   - Improved validation:
     * Validates group codes properly
     * Ensures values are found
     * Maintains proper line pairing

**Results:**
- Successfully parses indented DXF content
- Handles empty lines and whitespace
- Provides better error context
- More resilient to file variations

**Next Steps:**
1. Test with more DXF file variations
2. Monitor error reporting in production
3. Consider adding recovery strategies for common issues
4. Update documentation with new parsing behavior

## Diagnosis Tools Setup
- Debug logging in DxfProcessor
- Line number tracking
- Group code validation
- File structure analysis

## Next Session Focus
1. Analyze testlinie.dxf format
2. Review line parsing logic
3. Test different DXF variations
4. Update error handling
