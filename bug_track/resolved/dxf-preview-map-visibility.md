# DXF Preview Map Visibility Fix

## Issue Status: RESOLVED
**Issue Identifier:** dxf-preview-map-visibility
**Component:** PreviewMap
**Impact Level:** High
**Tags:** #dxf #preview #layer-visibility #bug-fix

### Problem Statement
Preview map was not showing features for DXF imports even though the file was successfully processed and features were correctly extracted. The issue was caused by inconsistent handling of the "empty array means all layers visible" convention between components.

### Error Indicators
- Preview map showing "Showing 0 of 0 features" despite successful file processing
- Layer visibility toggles present but not affecting display
- Cache hit rate 0.0%
- Features successfully processed but not displayed

## Key Discoveries
- Discovery #1: Layer Visibility Convention Mismatch
  - PreviewManager used empty array to mean "all layers visible"
  - usePreviewState was not properly implementing this convention
  - This caused features to be filtered out when they should be visible

- Discovery #2: Cache Handling
  - Cached features needed to respect the same visibility convention
  - Visibility filtering needed to be consistent between cached and non-cached paths

## Understanding Corrections
- Correction #1: Layer Visibility Implementation
  - What we thought: Layer visibility was broken in PreviewManager
  - Why it was wrong: PreviewManager implementation was correct
  - Actual issue: usePreviewState wasn't following the same convention
  - Changes needed: Update usePreviewState to properly handle empty array

## Solution Attempts Log

### Attempt #1 - Fix Layer Visibility Convention
**Hypothesis:** usePreviewState needs to properly implement "empty array means all layers visible"
**Tags:** #layer-visibility #preview-state
**Approach:** Update feature filtering logic in usePreviewState

**Changes Overview:**
```diff
components/geo-loader/components/preview-map/hooks/use-preview-state.ts | 50 ++++++++++++------
```

**Critical Code Changes:**
- Updated feature filtering to skip layer filtering when visibleLayers is empty
- Applied consistent handling for both cached and non-cached features
- Fixed visibleCount calculation to reflect actual visible features

**Outcome:** Success
**Side Effects:** None observed
**Next Steps:** Monitor for any performance impacts with large files

## Diagnosis Tools Setup
- Console logging in PreviewManager for layer visibility state
- Debug logging for feature filtering operations
- Cache hit rate monitoring

## Next Session Focus
1. Monitor performance with large DXF files
2. Verify cache efficiency
3. Consider adding visibility state tests

## Testing Notes
- Test with empty DXF files
- Test with single layer files
- Test with multiple layer files
- Verify layer toggle behavior
- Check coordinate system handling
- Verify preview update triggers
