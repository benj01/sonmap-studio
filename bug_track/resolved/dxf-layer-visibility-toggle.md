# Debug Tracking Log

## Issue Status: RESOLVED
**Issue Identifier:** dxf-layer-visibility-toggle
**Component:** DXF Import Dialog - Layer Visibility Controls
**Impact Level:** Medium
**Tags:** #ui #dxf #layer-visibility #preview

### Problem Statement
Layer visibility toggle switches in the DXF import dialog were showing the opposite state of the actual layer visibility in the preview map. When switches were ON, layers were hidden, and when switches were OFF, layers were visible.

### Error Indicators
- Layer visibility switches showing ON state but no features visible in preview
- Toggling switches to OFF state shows features in preview
- Inconsistent user experience with toggle state not matching visual feedback

## Key Discoveries
- The preview filtering logic in PreviewManager was correct
- The UI toggle state was inverted compared to the expected behavior
- The visibleLayers array was being used correctly for filtering
- The issue was purely in the UI representation of the state

## Solution Attempts Log

### Attempt #1 - Invert Toggle State
**Hypothesis:** The UI toggle state needs to be inverted to match the expected behavior
**Tags:** #ui #state-management
**Approach:** Invert the checked state of the Switch components in DxfStructureView

**Changes Overview:**
```diff
components/geo-loader/components/dxf-structure-view.tsx | 10 ++--
```

**Outcome:** Success
- Toggle switches now correctly represent layer visibility
- ON state shows features in preview
- OFF state hides features in preview
- Consistent with user expectations

## Impact Analysis
- No changes to underlying data structures or state management
- Pure UI improvement for better user experience
- No performance impact
- No changes to file processing or preview generation

## Documentation Updates
- Updated DEVELOPMENT_TRACKER.md to include layer visibility improvements
- Added to version history for v0.4.6
