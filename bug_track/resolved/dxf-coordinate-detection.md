# Debug Tracking Log

## Issue Status: ACTIVE
**Issue Identifier:** dxf-coordinate-detection
**Component:** DXF Processor
**Impact Level:** High
**Tags:** #dxf #coordinates #preview #EPSG2056

### Problem Statement
DXF import fails to properly detect and handle Swiss LV95 (EPSG:2056) coordinates, resulting in no preview map being shown. The test file 'testlinie.dxf' contains coordinates clearly in EPSG:2056 range but the system fails to handle them correctly.

### Error Indicators
- No preview map shown
- Error: "createPreviewManager is not defined"
- Coordinate system detection not working properly
- Preview generation failing

### Key Discoveries
1. Coordinate system detection timing issue
   - Previous understanding: Could detect coordinate system after feature conversion
   - Actual behavior: Need to detect from raw coordinates before conversion
   - Implication: Features were being converted with wrong coordinate system
   - Impact: Need to detect coordinate system from raw DXF entities first

2. Type validation chain issues
   - Previous understanding: Type errors were in feature validation
   - Actual behavior: Multiple points of type mismatch in conversion chain
   - Implication: Features being dropped at various validation points
   - Impact: Need comprehensive type safety throughout chain

3. Preview manager initialization
   - Previous understanding: Preview manager was self-contained
   - Actual behavior: Requires proper coordinate system initialization
   - Implication: Preview fails without proper coordinate context
   - Impact: Need to ensure coordinate system is set before preview

### Understanding Corrections
1. Coordinate System Detection
   - What we thought: Could detect from converted features
   - Why it was wrong: Features were already transformed incorrectly
   - Actual issue: Need raw coordinate analysis first
   - Required changes: Added calculateBoundsFromEntities method

2. Type Safety in Conversion Chain
   - What we thought: Simple type casting would work
   - Why it was wrong: Multiple points of type validation needed
   - Actual issue: Incomplete type definitions and guards
   - Required changes: Added proper type validation throughout chain

## Solution Attempts Log

### Attempt #1 - Fix Coordinate System Manager Integration
**Hypothesis:** Coordinate system detection fails because manager not initialized
**Tags:** #initialization #validation
**Approach:**
1. Add proper import for coordinateSystemManager
2. Ensure manager is initialized before coordinate detection
3. Add validation against system bounds
4. Add more robust coordinate system detection

**Changes Overview:**
```diff
src/dxf/processor.ts | +50 ----++++++
```

**Critical Code Changes:**
```typescript
// Ensure coordinate system manager is initialized
if (!coordinateSystemManager.isInitialized()) {
  await coordinateSystemManager.initialize();
}

// Validate against system bounds
const lv95Def = coordinateSystemManager.getSystemDefinition('EPSG:2056');
if (lv95Def && coordinateSystemManager.validateBounds({ x: bounds.minX, y: bounds.minY }, 'EPSG:2056')) {
  detectedSystem = 'EPSG:2056';
}
```

**Outcome:** Partial Success - Fixed initialization but preview still failing
**Side Effects:** None observed
**Next Steps:** 
1. Add unit tests for coordinate system detection
2. Add validation for edge cases (coordinates near system bounds)
3. Improve error messages for coordinate transformation failures

### Attempt #2 - Fix Type Safety in Conversion Chain
**Hypothesis:** Type mismatches causing features to be dropped
**Tags:** #typescript #validation
**Approach:**
1. Add proper type definitions for DXF entities
2. Add type guards throughout conversion chain
3. Fix validation of coordinates and bounds
4. Add comprehensive error logging

**Changes Overview:**
```diff
src/types.ts | +100 ----+++++++++
src/processor.ts | +75 ----+++++
```

**Critical Code Changes:**
```typescript
// Add type guard for vertex coordinates
const isValidVertex = (vertex: unknown): vertex is Vertex => {
  return typeof vertex === 'object' && vertex !== null &&
         typeof (vertex as any).x === 'number' &&
         typeof (vertex as any).y === 'number';
};

// Validate coordinates before bounds calculation
if (isValidVertex(vertex)) {
  updateBoundsWithCoord(vertex.x, vertex.y);
}
```

**Outcome:** In Progress
**Side Effects:** None observed yet
**Next Steps:**
1. Complete type safety improvements
2. Add tests for edge cases
3. Improve error reporting

## Next Session Focus
1. Fix preview manager initialization
2. Complete type safety improvements
3. Add comprehensive test suite
4. Improve error handling and reporting
