# DXF Import Issues - Status Update

## Core Issues - RESOLVED ✓

### 1. Processor Creation and Initialization ✓
- Added proper error handling and propagation
- Implemented processor state tracking
- Added cleanup and disposal mechanisms
- Enhanced error context and recovery

### 2. Coordinate System Detection ✓
- Implemented progressive detection strategy:
  * First tries user-provided system
  * Then attempts header-based detection with verification
  * Falls back to point-based detection for Swiss coordinates
- Added confidence levels and detailed logging
- Improved fallback mechanisms
- Enhanced validation for edge cases

### 3. Error Handling and Reporting ✓
- Unified error handling through ErrorReporter
- Added structured error types and codes
- Improved error propagation chain
- Added comprehensive logging
- Enhanced error recovery mechanisms

### 4. Preview Generation ✓
- Added validation in preview generation
- Improved error handling for preview failures
- Added detailed logging of preview process
- Enhanced layer visibility handling
- Fixed bounds calculation for all geometry types
- Added default bounds when no coordinates found
- Made updateBounds consistent with calculateBoundsFromFeatures

### 5. Component Communication ✓
- Enhanced GeoImportDialog error handling
- Added better progress reporting
- Improved state synchronization
- Added detailed logging
