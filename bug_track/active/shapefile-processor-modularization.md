- ✓ Type safety has been improved

## Implemented Structure

### 1. Core Module (processor.ts) ✓
- ✓ Main ShapefileProcessor class refactored
- ✓ Basic initialization and cleanup implemented
- ✓ High-level process flow control established
- ✓ Event handling improved

### 2. Conversion Module (converters/index.ts) ✓
- ✓ GeoJSON conversion logic in converters/geojson.ts
- ✓ PostGIS conversion logic in converters/postgis.ts
- ✓ Coordinate system handling integrated

### 3. Bounds Module (utils/bounds.ts) ✓
- ✓ Bounds calculation for features implemented
- ✓ Bounds calculation for records implemented
- ✓ Bounds update utilities added
- ✓ Default bounds handling improved

### 4. Statistics Module (utils/stats.ts) ✓
- ✓ Statistics tracking implemented
- ✓ Feature type counting added
- ✓ Batch processing stats support
- ✓ Error tracking integrated

### 5. Transaction Module (database/transaction.ts) ✓
- ✓ Transaction handling implemented
- ✓ Batch processing support
- ✓ Database operations integrated

## Implementation Status

1. Directory Structure ✓
   - [x] Created converters directory
   - [x] Created utils directory
   - [x] Created database directory

2. Conversion Logic ✓
   - [x] Moved GeoJSON conversion to converters/geojson.ts
   - [x] Moved PostGIS conversion to converters/postgis.ts
   - [x] Created converters/index.ts to export both

3. Bounds Logic ✓
   - [x] Moved bounds calculation to utils/bounds.ts
   - [x] Updated references in processor.ts
   - [x] Added coordinate validation

4. Statistics Logic ✓
   - [x] Moved statistics handling to utils/stats.ts
   - [x] Updated references in processor.ts
   - [x] Added batch statistics support

5. Transaction Logic ✓
   - [x] Moved transaction handling to database/transaction.ts
   - [x] Updated references in processor.ts
   - [x] Added batch processing support

6. Core Processor Updates ✓
   - [x] Refactored processor.ts to use new modules
   - [x] Added proper imports
   - [x] Updated type definitions
   - [x] Improved error handling

7. Testing - PENDING
   - [ ] Add unit tests for each module
   - [ ] Add integration tests

## Additional Improvements Beyond Original Plan

1. Enhanced Coordinate System Handling ✓
   - [x] Dedicated PRJ reader implementation
   - [x] Improved coordinate transformation
   - [x] Better error handling and logging
   - [x] Coordinate system validation

2. Improved Error Handling ✓
   - [x] Better error tracking in statistics
   - [x] Detailed error messages
   - [x] Proper error propagation

3. Performance Optimizations ✓
   - [x] Batch processing support
   - [x] Memory usage optimizations
   - [x] Streaming support for large files

## Current Status
The modularization is largely complete with all major components implemented and functioning. The code is now well-organized, maintainable, and type-safe. The only remaining task is the implementation of comprehensive tests.

### Remaining Tasks
1. Testing Implementation
   - [ ] Design test strategy
   - [ ] Implement unit tests for each module
   - [ ] Implement integration tests
   - [ ] Add test coverage reporting

## Benefits Achieved
- ✓ Clear separation of concerns
- ✓ Improved maintainability
- ✓ Better type safety
- ✓ Enhanced error handling
- ✓ Optimized performance
- ✓ Better code organization
- ✓ Improved debugging capabilities
