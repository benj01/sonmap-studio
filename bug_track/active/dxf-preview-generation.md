# Debug Tracking Log

## Issue Status: ACTIVE
**Issue Identifier:** dxf-preview-generation
**Component:** GeoImportDialog, PreviewMap
**Impact Level:** High
**Tags:** #dxf #preview #map #bug

### Problem Statement
DXF file preview is not displaying in the import dialog despite successful entity parsing. The preview map remains empty while layer controls and coordinate system detection appear to function.

### Error Indicators
- No preview features displayed in map
- Debug logs show "No preview features generated from entities"
- Entity array length: 0 in conversion process
- Preview collections show zero features: `{points: 0, lines: 0, polygons: 0, total: 0}`

## Key Discoveries

Discovery #1: Feature Conversion Chain
- Previous understanding: Entity parsing failure was causing empty preview
- Actual behavior: Entities are parsed successfully but feature conversion fails silently
- Implication: Issue lies in the conversion process between parsed entities and GeoJSON features
- Impact: Need to focus on the entity-to-feature conversion logic

Discovery #2: Preview Collection Categorization
- Previous understanding: Features were not being properly categorized by geometry type
- Actual behavior: No features are reaching the categorization stage
- Implication: Issue occurs before feature categorization in preview manager
- Impact: Need to verify feature generation before categorization logic

Discovery #3: Component Communication
- Previous understanding: Preview map display issues were UI-related
- Actual behavior: Empty feature collections are being properly handled by UI
- Implication: Problem is in data preparation, not display logic
- Impact: Focus debugging on feature generation pipeline

## Current Understanding
1. Data Flow Status:
   - Entity parsing works (finds LWPOLYLINE entities)
   - Feature conversion fails silently
   - Preview generation receives no features
   - UI components function but have no data to display

2. Component Chain:
   - DxfProcessor → EntityParser → FeatureManager → PreviewManager → PreviewMap
   - Break in chain occurs between EntityParser and FeatureManager

3. Validation Points:
   - Entity structure validation succeeds
   - Feature conversion validation may be too strict
   - Preview collection categorization works but receives no data

## Solution Attempts Log

### Attempt #1 - Enhanced Debug Logging
**Hypothesis:** Silent failure in feature conversion is hiding the root cause
**Tags:** #debugging #logging
**Approach:** Added comprehensive debug logging throughout conversion chain

**Changes Overview:**
```diff
entity-parser.ts     | +50 Added detailed logging
preview-manager.ts   | +20 Added collection logging
map-layers.ts        | +10 Updated style expressions
```

**Outcome:** Partial Success
- Identified exact point of failure in conversion chain
- Confirmed entity parsing works correctly
- Located feature conversion failure point

**Side Effects:** None observed
**Next Steps:** 
1. Investigate feature conversion logic in EntityParser
2. Add validation checks in conversion process
3. Verify coordinate handling in feature generation

## Diagnosis Tools Setup
- Added debug logging in EntityParser
- Added feature collection statistics logging
- Added geometry type tracking
- Enhanced error reporting in conversion chain

## Next Session Focus
1. Debug feature conversion process in EntityParser
2. Verify coordinate transformation logic
3. Test feature validation criteria
4. Add error context to conversion failures

# Log Maintenance Notes
- Focus on feature conversion chain
- Track all entity parsing successes/failures
- Monitor coordinate system handling
- Document any geometry validation issues
