# Shapefile Preview Fix

## Issue Description
The import dialog for shapefiles is not displaying the preview map as expected. The dialog shows an empty preview area despite successfully loading the shapefile data.

## Investigation Progress

### Code Analysis
1. Analyzed the complete data flow from file import to preview rendering:
   - ShapefileParser: Reads and parses raw shapefile data
   - GeoJSON Converter: Converts shapefile records to GeoJSON features
   - Preview Manager: Handles feature display and caching
   - Feature Processor: Categorizes and processes features for display

2. Implemented fixes:
   - Added proper bounding box handling in shapefile parser
   - Fixed type issues in GeoJSON conversion
   - Added comprehensive debug logging throughout the pipeline
   - Improved error handling and validation

3. Key Components Updated:
   - `ShapefileParser`: Now properly reads and validates shapefile records with bounding boxes
   - `GeoJSON Converter`: Enhanced to preserve bounding box information during conversion
   - `PreviewManager`: Verified feature handling and layer visibility management
   - `FeatureProcessor`: Confirmed proper feature categorization and bounds calculation

### Current Status
- Parser successfully reads shapefile data with correct coordinates and bounds
- GeoJSON conversion maintains spatial information
- Preview manager receives properly formatted features
- Debug logging added to track data flow
- Coordinate system detection from PRJ files implemented
- Coordinate transformation pipeline integrated with coordinateSystemManager
- Proper error handling and recovery for transformation failures added

### Next Steps
1. Test the implementation with various sample shapefiles:
   - Files with different coordinate systems
   - Files with and without PRJ files
   - Files with complex geometries
2. Verify preview rendering with transformed coordinates
3. Monitor error handling in production scenarios
4. Consider adding coordinate system auto-detection fallback if PRJ is missing

### Recent Improvements
1. Coordinate System Handling:
   - Added PRJ file detection and parsing
   - Implemented coordinate system detection from PRJ content
   - Added fallback to WGS84 when no system is detected
   - Enhanced error handling for missing or invalid PRJ files

2. Coordinate Transformation:
   - Integrated coordinateSystemManager for transformations
   - Added transformation from source to WGS84 for preview
   - Improved error handling and recovery
   - Added detailed logging for debugging

3. Feature Processing:
   - Enhanced feature loading with coordinate awareness
   - Improved bounds calculation after transformation
   - Added validation for transformed coordinates
   - Optimized memory usage during transformation

## Continuation Prompt
To continue debugging this issue, we should:
1. Check the feature manager's feature loading process
2. Verify coordinate transformations are applied correctly
3. Test the preview rendering with sample data
4. Add error recovery for edge cases

Use this prompt:
"Please help continue debugging the shapefile preview issue. We've fixed the parser and GeoJSON conversion. Now we need to verify the feature manager's feature loading process and coordinate transformations. Let's start by examining the feature manager implementation and its interaction with the preview system."
