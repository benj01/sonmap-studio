# Geo-Loader Development Tracker

## Current Status

### Active Issues
1. DXF Parser Integration (Resolved)
   - Browser compatibility implementation complete
   - Dynamic import system validated
   - Webpack configuration tested
   - Enhanced error handling and logging implemented
   - Parser initialization issues resolved
   - Type safety improvements completed
   - Code modularized into focused components
   - See bug_track/resolved/dxf-parser-integration.md

2. DXF Import and Preview (In Progress)
   - Root cause identified: Multiple issues in processing chain
   - Coordinate system detection fixed with DxfAnalyzer module
   - Type safety improved with focused modules
   - Preview manager initialization fixed
   - Next steps: Test with various coordinate systems
   - See bug_track/active/dxf-coordinate-detection.md

3. Preview Generation (In Progress)
   - Issue: Preview manager initialization and feature handling
   - Root cause addressed with modular architecture
   - Features now converted with correct coordinate system
   - Type safety improved with focused modules
   - Next steps: Comprehensive testing
   - See bug_track/active/dxf-preview-generation.md

### Required Actions
1. Testing New Modular Structure
   - Test each module independently
   - Verify module interactions
   - Test with various DXF files
   - Verify error handling in each module
   - Update documentation with module-specific details

2. DXF Import Enhancement
   - Test coordinate system detection with DxfAnalyzer
   - Verify entity processing with DxfEntityProcessor
   - Test layer handling with DxfLayerProcessor
   - Verify coordinate transformations with DxfTransformer
   - Add comprehensive module tests

3. Investigation Areas
   - Module boundary interactions
   - Error propagation between modules
   - Performance impact of modularization
   - Memory usage patterns
   - Module initialization order

## Known Issues

### Critical
1. Module Testing
   - Need comprehensive tests for each module
   - Module interaction tests needed
   - Performance impact assessment needed
   - See bug_track/active/dxf-module-testing.md

2. Documentation Updates
   - Module-specific documentation needed
   - API documentation updates required
   - Example usage documentation needed
   - See bug_track/active/dxf-documentation.md
