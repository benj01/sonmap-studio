## Known Issues

### Critical
1. DXF Import and Preview
   - Feature conversion fails silently in entity parser
   - Preview map receives no features despite successful parsing
   - Multiple validation points may cause silent failures
   - Error context missing in conversion chain
   - See bug_track/active/dxf-preview-generation.md

2. Coordinate System Detection
   - Simple DXF files may not detect coordinate system due to strict thresholds
   - Multiple error handlers causing fragmented error reporting
   - Component communication and state management problems

### Non-Critical
1. Performance
   - Parallel processing not yet implemented
   - Memory optimization opportunities remain
   - Cache invalidation could be improved

2. Documentation
   - Advanced features need better documentation
   - More examples needed for complex use cases
   - Performance guidelines could be expanded
   - API documentation needs updating

3. User Experience
   - Error messages could be more user-friendly
   - Progress reporting could be more detailed
   - Debugging tools could be improved
   - Visualization tools could be enhanced
