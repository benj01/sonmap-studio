2. DXF Import Enhancement
   - Test coordinate system detection with DxfAnalyzer
   - Verify entity processing with DxfEntityProcessor
   - Test layer handling with DxfLayerProcessor
   - Verify coordinate transformations with DxfTransformer
   - Add comprehensive module tests

3. Investigation Areas
   - Module boundary interactions
   - Error propagation between modules
   - Performance impact of modularization
   - Memory usage patterns
   - Module initialization order
