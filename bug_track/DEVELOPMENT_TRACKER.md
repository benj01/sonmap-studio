# Geo-Loader Development Tracker

## Current Status

### Active Issues
1. DXF Parser Integration (In Progress)
   - Browser compatibility implementation complete
   - Dynamic import system implemented
   - Webpack configuration updated for proper module loading
   - Enhanced error handling and logging added
   - Next steps: Testing and validation
   - See bug_track/active/dxf-parser-integration.md

2. DXF Import and Preview (In Progress)
   - Root cause identified: TypeScript type errors in validation chain
   - Layer parsing works but data not propagating to UI
   - Entity parsing succeeds but features dropped in validation
   - Coordinate system detection working (WGS84)
   - Next steps: Fix validation chain and layer propagation
   - See bug_track/active/dxf-preview-generation.md

3. Preview Generation (In Progress)
   - Issue: No features reaching preview manager
   - Root cause identified: TypeScript type errors in validation chain
   - Layer parsing works but data not propagating to UI
   - Entity parsing succeeds but features dropped in validation
   - Coordinate system detection working (WGS84)
   - Next steps: Fix validation chain and layer propagation
   - See bug_track/active/dxf-preview-generation.md

### Required Actions
1. DXF Parser Integration
   - Test parser initialization in browser environment
   - Verify error handling with various DXF files
   - Monitor performance and memory usage
   - Test with different DXF file formats
   - Update documentation with browser-specific considerations

2. DXF Import Enhancement
   - Fix TypeScript type definitions in validation chain
   - Implement proper type guards for geometry validation
   - Fix layer data propagation to UI components
   - Update validation criteria for features
   - Add comprehensive debug logging
   - Test with various DXF formats

3. Investigation Areas
   - TypeScript type definitions for geometry validation
   - Layer data propagation through component chain
   - Feature validation criteria
   - Coordinate transformation logic
   - Bounds calculation process
   - Feature manager integration

## Known Issues

### Critical
1. DXF Parser Module Structure
   - TypeScript module export issues
   - Validation chain incomplete
   - Error context missing in conversion chain
   - See bug_track/active/dxf-parser-refactoring.md

2. DXF Import and Preview
   - TypeScript type errors in validation chain
   - Layer data not propagating to UI
   - Features dropped during validation
   - Multiple validation points causing silent failures
   - See bug_track/active/dxf-preview-generation.md

3. Coordinate System Detection
   - Working correctly for WGS84
   - Bounds calculation may need verification
   - Multiple error handlers causing fragmented error reporting
   - Component communication and state management problems
