Summary:

This file defines a React component called PreviewMap that displays a map with geospatial data overlaid on it. It uses react-map-gl to render the map and handles data loading, zooming, panning, feature filtering, clustering, and hover interactions.

Imports:

React, useEffect, useMemo, useState, useCallback for component state and lifecycle management.
Map, Source, Layer, AttributionControl, ViewStateChangeEvent, MapRef from react-map-gl for map rendering and interaction.
COORDINATE_SYSTEMS, isSwissSystem from ../types/coordinates for coordinate system handling.
layerStyles from ./map/map-layers for styling map layers.
PreviewMapProps from ../types/map for defining component props.
useMapView from ../hooks/use-map-view for managing map view state and bounds.
mapbox-gl/dist/mapbox-gl.css for Mapbox GL styles.
bboxPolygon from @turf/bbox-polygon and booleanIntersects from @turf/boolean-intersects for geospatial calculations.
FeatureCollection, Feature from geojson for GeoJSON type definitions.
createPreviewManager, PreviewManager from ../preview/preview-manager for managing features to be displayed.
Constants:

VIEWPORT_PADDING: (number) Padding to apply when focusing on features.
CLUSTER_RADIUS: (number) Radius for clustering points.
MIN_ZOOM_FOR_UNCLUSTERED: (number) Minimum zoom level at which point clusters are expanded.
Props:

preview: (FeatureCollection, optional) The GeoJSON data to display.
bounds: (number[], optional) The bounding box to initially focus the map on.
coordinateSystem: (string, optional) The coordinate system of the data (defaults to WGS84).
visibleLayers: (string[], optional) An array of layer names to display.
selectedElement: ({ type: string, layer: string }, optional) Information about a selected element.
analysis: (any, optional) Result of analysis of the data.
Component State:

isLoading: (boolean) Indicates whether data is currently being loaded.
error: (string | null) Stores any error message that occurred.
hoveredFeature: (any | null) The feature currently being hovered over.
mouseCoords: ({ lng: number; lat: number } | null) The current mouse coordinates on the map.
mapRef: (React.Ref<MapRef>) A ref to the react-map-gl Map component.
useMapView Hook:

The component uses the useMapView hook to manage the map's view state (e.g., latitude, longitude, zoom).
Provides functions:
onMove: Handles map movement events.
updateViewFromBounds: Updates the view to fit specified bounds.
focusOnFeatures: Focuses the map on a set of features.
getViewportBounds: Gets the current viewport bounds.
Preview Manager:

previewManagerRef: (React.Ref<PreviewManager | null>) A ref to a PreviewManager instance.
Initialization:
A useEffect hook creates or updates the PreviewManager whenever preview, visibleLayers, analysis, or coordinateSystem changes.
The PreviewManager is responsible for managing the features to be displayed, potentially applying filtering or other optimizations.
The manager is created using createPreviewManager providing settings like maxFeatures, visibleLayers, analysis and coordinateSystem.
preview is set to the manager using pm.setFeatures(preview).
Initial Zoom and Error Handling:

A useEffect hook handles setting the initial map view based on the provided bounds.
It calls updateViewFromBounds to adjust the view.
It includes error handling to catch any issues during this process and sets the error state accordingly.
Focus on Selected Element:

A useEffect hook handles focusing on a selected element (selectedElement).
It uses the PreviewManager to get features of a specific type and layer.
It calls focusOnFeatures to zoom to the selected features.
Includes error handling.
Map Move Handler:

handleMapMove: A callback function to handle map movement events.
It calls the onMove function from useMapView to update the view state.
Viewport Filtering (Optional):

viewportBounds: Calculates the current viewport bounds using getViewportBounds.
viewportPolygon: Creates a polygon representing the viewport using bboxPolygon.
The code then filters the features obtained from the PreviewManager based on whether they intersect with the viewportPolygon using booleanIntersects.
This is done to potentially improve performance by only rendering features within the current view.
Feature Collections and Layer Components:

The points, lines, and polygons are obtained from the preview manager using the getPreviewCollections method.
totalCount and visibleCount are also taken from the output of this method.
A useMemo hook creates Source and Layer components for each geometry type (points, lines, polygons) based on the filtered feature collections.
Point Clustering:
Points are clustered using the cluster option in the Source component.
clusterMaxZoom and clusterRadius control clustering behavior.
Separate layers are defined for clusters (clusters, cluster-count) and unclustered points (points).
Layer Styling:
Layer styles are applied using the layerStyles object imported from ./map/map-layers.
Mouse Move and Leave Handlers:

handleMouseMove: Updates the hoveredFeature state with the feature under the mouse cursor. Also updates mouseCoords with the current mouse coordinates.
handleMouseLeave: Resets hoveredFeature and mouseCoords to null when the mouse leaves the map.
Rendering:

Renders a div container for the map.
Loading Indicator: Displays a loading message while isLoading is true.
Error Message: Displays an error message if error is not null.
Map Component:
Renders the react-map-gl Map component.
Passes the current viewState from useMapView.
Sets onMove, onMouseMove, and onMouseLeave handlers.
Specifies mapboxAccessToken from environment variables.
Disables the default attribution control and adds a custom one.
Enables reuseMaps for performance.
Sets maxZoom and minZoom.
Specifies interactiveLayerIds to enable interactions with specific layers.
Renders the layerComponents (Sources and Layers) for the different geometry types.
Renders an AttributionControl in the bottom-right corner.
Displays a small overlay in the top-right corner showing the number of visible features and a message to zoom in to see individual points if clustering is active.
Displays a small overlay in the bottom-left corner showing the mouse coordinates.
Displays a tooltip when hovering over a feature, showing the layer name and potentially a warning message.
Potential Issues:

Performance with Large Datasets: While the component uses viewport filtering, performance might still be an issue with very large datasets. The filtering logic itself could become a bottleneck. In getPreviewCollections a combination of FeatureSampler and FeatureFilter is used. The FeatureSampler takes a random sample of features first before the filter is applied. This might be problematic because the filtered features might all be removed by the sampling process before.
Error Handling: The error handling is basic, only displaying a generic error message. More specific error messages and user guidance could be provided. Especially the error message in the initial zoom could provide more information, as errors there might be related to wrong coordinates.
Coordinate System Issues in updateViewFromBounds: The error message indicates potential issues with the updateViewFromBounds function, especially with Swiss coordinate systems. The bounds need to be transformed to the map's coordinate system (WGS84) before being used.
Hardcoded Map Style: The mapStyle is hardcoded to mapbox://styles/mapbox/light-v11. It might be better to make this configurable.
Clustering Logic: The clustering logic is relatively simple. More advanced clustering algorithms or options might be needed for certain use cases.
Tooltip Positioning: The tooltip positioning might not be optimal in all cases, especially near the edges of the map.
No Handling of Empty Data: The component doesn't explicitly handle cases where the preview data is empty or contains no features. This might be addressed with a specific message or by hiding the map altogether.
Overall:

The PreviewMap component is a well-structured component for displaying geospatial data on a map. It incorporates several features like zooming, panning, filtering, clustering, and hover interactions. However, there are potential performance issues with large datasets and coordinate system handling, and some aspects of error handling, styling, and clustering could be improved. The component also lacks proper handling of empty data scenarios. The filtering logic should also be reviewed.
