- Always use the context7 MCP server to reference documentation for libraries like React, Supabase, Cesium etc.
- For the tokens, start with 5000 but then increase to 20000 if your first search didn't give relevant information.

- Only search three times maximum for any specific piece of documentation. If you don't get what you need, use the Brave MCP server to perform a wider search or ask the user.
