# Version

- The app is using Next.js 15 with React 19
- zustand: ^5.0.2 is installed and used especially fot the map views

# dev mode

I am running the app with "npm run dev". So when writing code, take into consideration how React 18's Strict Mode works in development - it mounts, unmounts, and remounts components to help detect side effects.
